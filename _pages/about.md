Hello there. I'm Isabella, a Masters student at MIT working with Vincent Sitzmann in the Scene Representation Group. In Fall 2025, I'll be joining Berkeley EECS as PhD student. I'm interested in developing embodied agents with the rich 3D spatial reasoning capabilities of humans and animals, with an emphasis on developing learned representations of agent morphologies. To this end, I am interested in the fields of perception-for-robotics, graphics, and computational cognitive science.

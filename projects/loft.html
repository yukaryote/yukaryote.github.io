            <p>One of the reasons I wanted to live in East Campus at MIT was to have the freedom to customize the dorms. Naturally, when I went to MIT in person in the spring of 2021, I quickly set about building a loft.</p>

            <p>If it weren't for COVID, I would be doing this with other people, but alas, I found out that lugging, like, six 2-by-4's from the basement to Tetazoo (3rd floor on the east parallel of EC where I lived) by myself is quite a workout. Unfortunately, I don't have many pictures of the process because it was quite simple and I wasn't too pleased with how it turned out. The wood was moderately bent from being stuck in the basement, and there were only skinny 2-by-4's, which meant the legs were a bit wonky. I had to drill the legs into the wall to make the loft not wobble when I got onto it.</p>

            <p>Despite its jankiness, it was nice sleeping above the ground and having the extra desk space. The blue accents, even if unintentional, are nice. Sadly, it has been destroyed during the 2024 EC rEnoVaTiOn :')</p>
